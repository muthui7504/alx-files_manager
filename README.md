# Files Manager


## Testing and Jobs

A queueing job mechanism for creating thumbnails of photos uploaded to the application is included in the project. When a new user is created, it also leverages this feature to generate a welcome message. Bull is used in all of this.Â

Mocha is used in combination with Chai for testing the app.
